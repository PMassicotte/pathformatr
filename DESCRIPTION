Title: Format traditional file paths for use with here::here()
Version: 0.1.0.900
Authors@R: c( 
    person("Luke", "McGuinness",
           role = c("aut", "cre"),
           email = "luke.mcguinness@bristol.ac.uk"))
Description: This function formats a file path highlighted in the source pane
    to work with here::here() by separating the string into its component
    parts, and then quoting and comma-separating these elements. This 
    functionality is  useful as it allows for users to autocomplete paths 
    using the RStudio auto-complete functionality, and then rapdily reformat the
    resulting path for use with the here package.
