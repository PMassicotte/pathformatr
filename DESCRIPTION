Title: Format File Paths To Be Platform-Independent
Version: 0.1.0.900

Description: This package allows users to easily (re-)format standard file paths
    in here::here() or file.path() function calls to be platform-independent by 
    separating the file path string into its component parts and then quoting 
    and comma-separating each elements. This is particularly useful as it allows
    for users to complete file paths using RStudio's built-in auto-complete 
    functionality, and then rapidly reformat the resulting path for use with 
    here::here() or file.path(). For ease of use, an RStudio AddIn allows for 
    the functionality to be mapped to a keyboard shortcut.
